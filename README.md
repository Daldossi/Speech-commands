# Speech-commands
A problem of speech recognition is solved using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). In particular, I will try to recognize the sound of 35 commands (backward, bed, bird, cat, dog, down, eight, five, follow, forward, four, go, happy, house, learn, left, marvin, nine, no, off, on, one, right, seven, sheila, six, stop, three, tree, two, up, visual, wow, yes, zero) from a training set of 84291 audio clips uttered by many different speakers. I will compare the results obtained from the MLP built with different size of the batch of the gradient descent, different number of hidden layers and of neurons. Moreover, I will study the best feature normalization (min-max scaling, mean-var scaling, max abs scaling, whitening transform, instance normalization). Once obtained a quite good neural network I will try to analyze its performance.
